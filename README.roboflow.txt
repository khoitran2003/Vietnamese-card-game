The dataset includes 24240 images.
Cards are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Randomly crop between 0 and 15 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -10 and +10 degrees
* Random shear of between -2째 to +2째 horizontally and -2째 to +2째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.75 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 2 percent of pixels
